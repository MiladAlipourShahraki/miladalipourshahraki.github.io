I am currently in my second year of the Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University, where I work as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor Laurent Lessard. Additionally, I hold a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering. My research interests at present encompass control theory, safety-critical control, optimization, and system stability analysis.

## Research Interests
* Control Theory and Applications <br>
* Adaptive Learning Control and Optimization <br>
Safety-Critical Control and Stability Analysis <br>
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning <br>
