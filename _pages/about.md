I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Fasa University, Fars, Iran, in 2017, and the University of Isfahan, Iran, in 2020, respectively. My broad area of interest is in control theory, optimization, and system stability analysis. I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position to expand my knowledge in the application of reinforcement learning and adaptive learning-based controllers in nonlinear systems.
