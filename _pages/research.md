My current research revolves around the fascinating field of safety-critical control, where I focus on utilizing Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for nonlinear systems. The integration of CLFs and CBFs offers robust and reliable control strategies that can ensure system stability and safety in real-time applications. The significance of safety-critical control lies in its applicability to a wide range of systems, including autonomous vehicles, aerospace systems, and medical devices, where ensuring stability and safety are of paramount importance.
